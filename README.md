### About the Project

This project analyzes the residential rental market in Chile, which has experienced significant growth over the past 15 years. By proposing new indicators based on internet listings, the project aims to understand the evolution of rental and sale prices and their implications for the financial system and real economy.

### Key Features

- **New Indicators**: Developed new measures based on internet listings to analyze the rental market.
- **Price Dynamics**: Studied the impact of market slack on price dynamics at the micro level.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Covered various geographical areas in Santiago to provide a detailed understanding of market trends.

### Key Results

- **Price Increases**: Both rental and sale prices increased across different areas in Santiago over the last decade.
- **Market Slack**: The proposed slack measure is relevant for understanding short-term price pressures during periods of lower availability.
- **Economic Impact**: The findings highlight the importance of the rental market for the financial system and real economy.

### Data Overview

The dataset includes internet listings of residential properties in Santiago, Chile, covering various fault conditions. Key data points:

- **Source**: Internet listings from Portalinmobiliario.com, provided by Mercado Libre.
- **Time Period**: Data from 2007 to 2018.
- **Geographical Coverage**: Various communes in Santiago.

### Methodology

This project utilizes hedonic pricing models to analyze the rental market:

- **Hedonic Pricing Models**: Estimate the value of each observable attribute of a property to calculate price evolution for a representative property.
- **Market Slack Measure**: Developed a measure based on the incidence and duration of rental listings to understand market slack.
- **Data Filtering**: Applied filters to remove outliers and ensure data quality.

**Hyperparameters**: 
- Models were estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and controlled for regional fixed effects.
